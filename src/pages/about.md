I'm Emil, a software engineer. I'm generally curious about a wide variety of topics, so you'll find me exploring a lot of areas (most of the time related to software engineering, but not always).

## About this blog

I've always wanted to write down my thoughts as I ran through ideas. I'd love to reach back and search my past impressions on things, rather than hope to assimilate them in my head. That said this blog will contain information about (in no particular order):
- software engineering & programming
- programming languages
- software engineering processes
- cryptography & web3
- company building & leadership
- governance
