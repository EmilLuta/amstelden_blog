I'm Emil, a software engineer. I'm generally curious about a wide variety of topics, so you'll find me exploring a lot of areas (most of the time related to software engineering, but not always).

## Another blog, yes, but why?

I wanted to write down my thoughts on various topics for a long time. As my day-to-day interests change based on which season of my life I'm in, it's hard to keep up with everything I've digested so far. Wouldn't it be great if I had some notes to bring me up-to-speed? My brain can only hold that much information and besides, sharing is caring (what if someone might find this information useful?). That said this blog will contain information about (in no particular order):
- software engineering & programming
- programming languages
- software engineering processes
- cryptography & web3
- systems programming
- company building & leadership
- governance
